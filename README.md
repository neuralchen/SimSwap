# SimSwap: An Efficient Framework For High Fidelity Face Swapping
## Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia
**The official repository with Pytorch**
PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Meta AI. It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license. 

**Our method can realize **arbitrary face swapping** on images and videos with **one single trained model**.**

***We are recruiting full-time engineers. If you are interested, please send an [email](mailto:chen19910528@sjtu.edu.cn?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Han%20Sans) to my team.

## Top News <img width=8% src="./docs/img/new.gif"/>

**`2023-09-26`**: We fixed bugs in colab!

**`2023-04-25`**: We fixed the "AttributeError: 'SGD' object has no attribute 'defaults' now" bug. If you have already downloaded **arcface_checkpoint.tar**, please **download it again**. Also, you also need to update the scripts in ```./models/```.

**`2022-04-21`**: For resource limited users, we provide the cropped VGGFace2-224 dataset [[Google Driver] VGGFace2-224 (10.8G)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19pWvdEHS-CEG6tW3PdxdtZ5QEymVjImc/view?usp=sharing) [[Baidu Driver]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1OiwLJHVBSYB4AY2vEcfN0A) [Password: lrod].

**`2022-04-20`**: Training scripts are now available. We highly recommend that you guys train the simswap model with our released high quality dataset [VGGFace2-HQ](https://github.com/NNNNAI/VGGFace2-HQ).

**`2021-11-24`**: We have trained a beta version of ***SimSwap-HQ*** on [VGGFace2-HQ](https://github.com/NNNNAI/VGGFace2-HQ) and open sourced the checkpoint of this model (if you think the Simswap 512 is cool, please star our  [VGGFace2-HQ](https://github.com/NNNNAI/VGGFace2-HQ) repo). Please don’t forget to go to [Preparation](./docs/guidance/preparation.md) and [Inference for image or video face swapping](./docs/guidance/usage.md) to check the latest set up.

**`2021-11-23`**: The google drive link of [VGGFace2-HQ](https://github.com/NNNNAI/VGGFace2-HQ) is released. 

**`2021-11-17`**: We released a high resolution face dataset [VGGFace2-HQ](https://github.com/NNNNAI/VGGFace2-HQ) and the method to generate this dataset. This dataset is for research purpose. 

**`2021-08-30`**: Docker has been supported, please refer [here](https://replicate.ai/neuralchen/simswap-image) for details.

**`2021-08-17`**: We have updated the [Preparation](./docs/guidance/preparation.md), The main change is that the gpu version of onnx is now installed by default, Now the time to process a video is greatly reduced.

**`2021-07-19`**: ***Obvious border abruptness has been resolved***. We add the ability to using mask and upgrade the old algorithm for better visual effect, please go to [Inference for image or video face swapping](./docs/guidance/usage.md) for details. Please don’t forget to go to [Preparation](./docs/guidance/preparation.md) to check the latest set up.

## Training

[Preparation](./docs/guidance/preparation.md)

The training script is slightly different from the original version, e.g., we replace the patch discriminator with the projected discriminator, which saves a lot of hardware overhead and achieves slightly better results.

In order to ensure the normal training, the batch size must be greater than 1.

Friendly reminder, due to the difference in training settings, the user-trained model will have subtle differences in visual effects from the pre-trained model we provide.

- Train 224 models with VGGFace2 224*224 [[Google Driver] VGGFace2-224 (10.8G)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19pWvdEHS-CEG6tW3PdxdtZ5QEymVjImc/view?usp=sharing) [[Baidu Driver] ](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1OiwLJHVBSYB4AY2vEcfN0A) [Password: lrod]

For faster convergence and better results, a large batch size (more than 16) is recommended!

***We recommend training more than 400K iterations (batch size is 16), 600K~800K will be better, more iterations will not be recommended.***


```
python train.py --name simswap224_test --batchSize 8  --gpu_ids 0 --dataset /path/to/VGGFace2HQ --Gdeep False
```

For faster convergence and better results, a large batch size (more than 16) is recommended!
